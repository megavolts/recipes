## For 6 Knödel ##

* 6 apricots (plums are good too, some people use strawberries or just nougat. IMO plums and apricots are superior.)
* 6 sugar cubes 
* 250g quark (drain first if it is the wet kind)
* 130g flour
* ~50g soft butter
* 1 egg

Mix butter, egg, quark. There should be no lumps of butter. Add flour, mix. 

Take the stones out of the apricots, replace with sugar cubes. Shape Knödel around the apricots with the dough, avoid holes, apricot should be complketely covered (easier with wet hands).

Put in simering water for 10-12min, Knödel should float when done. Leave in water longer if the apricots are big or the sugar inside wont dissolve.


## V. important second step: ##

Melt butter in pan, add Semmelbrösel (bread crumbs), sugar and cinnamon. Be generous with the butter. Let the mixture caramelize a bit. Put it on the Knödel for serving and/or put Knödel in the pan with it. Some people use a ton of crumbs, some just a little, this varies wildly and needs to be adjusted based on personal preference!
