Basic idea (Semmelknödel):
-300g old bread in small pieces (typically it's white bread)
-small glass milk
-2 eggs
-Approx 3 table spoons flour to bind the dough
-Salt, pepper, nutmeg


Variations (Spinatknödel, Rohnenknödel, Kasknödel):
-Spinach (I use approx. same weight bread & vegetables, ymmv), maybe an onion, maybe some garlic. I like a lot of nutmeg in the spinach version. Alternative: Pureed, cooked beet root. 
-Cheese (I always add plenty of cheese to the dough, some people don't for the vegetable and plain versions. I think gruyère or similar is best.)

Mix milk, eggs, cheese, spices and pour over bread. Add cooked vegetables (e.g. sautéed spinach with onion...). Let it soak for a bit to soften bread. Add some flour. With spinach/beets you get better colours if you put it through a food processor/ immersion blender but not required. Shape Knödel (wet hands). Dough should be easy to shape. 

Boil or steam for ~15 min. (If unsure about dough cook a test Knödel and add egg/flour if it falls apart. More egg makes Knödel more firm in general.)

Notes:
Spinach and beet version usually served with a lot of melted butter and grated parmesan or gruyère-type hard cheese.
Cheese version (Kasknödel) either in broth or flattened and fried with Sauerkraut or salad.
Plain Semmelknödel typically as side dish for roast or stew.
Speckknödel = Semmelknödel with Speck.
