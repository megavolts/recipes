## Ingredients
 <pre>
										           baker's percentage
- Bread flour				  500   g  100
- Sugar                60   g   12
- Dry yeast             5   g    1
- Egg                 250   g   50
- Whole milk          120   g   24
- Sourdough/Leaven    150   g   30
- Poolish					    200   g		40
- Butter              200   g   45
- salt						     12.5 g		 2.5
</pre>

## Preparation
0. Perform a float test on both leavan and sourdough
1. Mix flour, sourdough, poolish and 500 g of water together
2. Rest 40 minutes @ 80F for autolize
3. Incorporate the salt dissolved in 25g of warm water to the dough
4. Rest 2-3 hours @ 80F (bulk fermentation), give 2 turn in the first hour, 1 turn in the second hour
5. Form the baguette
6. Rest 1 to 2 hours @ 80F for final rise
7. Bake in a preheated and water saturated in the oven at 500F for 15 min @ 450F . 20 min @450F without lid
8. Bake for 15 min @ 450F in non-saturated oven

## Notes
* Baker's percentage are quantity express in fraction of the flour weight
* Feed the sourdough the day before, the sourdough need to pass the float test. The float test is passed if some sourdough float after being dropped in water
* Recipe could be easily simplified by skipping a few step:
** Dissolved salt in water can be added at step 1., it hinders a bit the flour hydratation, but it's ok. Then skip to step 4.
** Turn can be skipped, gluten will be a bit less devlopped and the loaf held less, but it's ok.
