## Notes
* Baker's percentage are quantity express in fraction of the flour weight
* To make the poolish, mix 100 g flour, 100 g lukewarm  water, and some yeast. Let rest for 3-4 hours at a 75-80, or overnight in the refrigerator. Alternatively, use some very active sarter, obtained by refreshing a sourdough every 4-5 hours for a few times, instead of yeast. This 50 g of this active starter can be used instead of the  yeast.
* Feed the sourdough the day before, the sourdough need to pass the float test. The float test is passed if the sourdough float after being dropped in water.
* To shape the dough the next day, freeze the dough for 3-5 hours, then transfer in the refrigerator overnight.
