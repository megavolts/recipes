## Notes
The original recipe from Girardet call for raspberries. Back home in Switzerland, my mother used to make it with red currents, their tartness balanced the sweetness of the dough. Here in Alaska, after several trial, I settle for a mix of blueberries and cranberries.

Leftover dough, could be frozen or kept a few days in a fridge

Adapt the volume of flan preparation to almost cover the berries. With increased volume, it may takes a bit more time to bake.

Serve with vanilla ice cream to be fully decadent. Recipe available at https://github.com/megavolts/recipes/tree/master/desert/ice_cream
